# Slingshots

Slingshots are *the* method of FTP travel in this universe (name has yet to
be determined). Slingshots always come in pairs, and move objects sent
through one to the other. Slingshots are not instantaneous like Stargates,
but they move ships at ridiculous speeds (lets say something like 20c for
right now, I don't have a scale of the galaxy or universe yet, so make it
whatever you want, I'm just using 20c because it's really fast).

Upon entering one of the portals, ships move at the above ridiculous speed,
and eventually make their way to the other end (after some short amount of
time, it doesn't have to be 'short', but shorter than if they had been
traveling at their standard speed of a couple hundred KpH).

Slingshots support bi-directional travel.

Because of how Slingshots work the only time multiple ships will still be in
contact with each other is if they enter the portal at the same time (as in,
the following ships have to enter while the lead ship is entering - an
object must be partially in the portal and partially out of the portal at
the same time all subsequent objects enter).

Two ships in a tunnel at the same time can use communications and weapon 
equipment. Otherwise, there isn't any reason to use weapons, and 
communcations don't work between the inside and outside of tunnels.

Ships all travel at the same speed inside of a Slingshot tunnel, and can't 
access their traditional engines. Should two ships enter at close to, but 
not exactly, the same time, they will exit at close to, but not exactly, the
same time.


## History

*This history supposes that this is the Milky Way galaxy that's being
explored. I don't know if I'm going to keep it as such (I like the idea of a
used universe, a la Star Wars and Firefly), but this is an adaptable history.
Use it as you will*

Slingshots were found by humans when they started traveling space. The first
was found just outside the Oort Cloud surrounding the Sol system, and
transports travelers to it's opposite, around Vega, which is some sort of
galactic transfer terminal. Vega is a transit hub for a large number of other
Slingshots, each leading to some strange locales.

Because humans have been exploring space for a large, incalculable amount
of time, most Slingshots have been explored, and maps exist for the parts of
the galaxy that have been explored. Most explored Slingshots contain a
navigational buoy that reports their locations (so people can get to them),
and their destinations (so people know where they're going).

The most populous civilizations are found residing closely to Slingshots that
were discovered early on. Newer discoveries have lead to newly founded
frontier worlds.
