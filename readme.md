# Space RPG Project

I've been looking for a generic space opera roleplaying game system for me to
add my own setting to, but haven't really been able to find one. I suppose
that could be because I'm looking for something that's also fairly 
rules-lite...

Basically, this is a collection of setting ideas, one-shot adventures, and
the basic mechanics that I want to govern this new universe.

I suppose the question of if this is a universe or not also applies. I'm
personally leaning towards it being whatever you want it to be, with this
being a collection of rules and possible settings that you might consider
using.
